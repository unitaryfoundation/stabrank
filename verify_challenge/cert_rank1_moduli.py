"""Certificate: chi >= 2 for |S> at m=1 and for |H>^2 and |T>^2 (qubits), exactly.

A stabilizer state has one modulus on its support (the amplitudes are a
root of unity times 1/sqrt(|support|)), so a state whose nonzero
amplitudes take two different moduli is not a stabilizer state and its
rank is at least 2. |S> = (|1> - |2>)/sqrt2 has support of size 2, which is
not an affine subspace of F_3 (those have size 1 or 3), and the qubit
states |H>^2 and |T>^2 have amplitude moduli cos^2 and cos sin of an angle
whose cosine and sine differ. Every step is exact in sympy.

Printed claims: CERTIFIED chi(S^1) >= 2
                CERTIFIED chi(qubit_H^2) >= 2
                CERTIFIED chi(qubit_T^2) >= 2
