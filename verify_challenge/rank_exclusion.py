"""Exhaustive rank-2 and rank-3 exclusion by quotienting out the target.

A lower bound chi(psi) >= r + 1 says that no r stabilizer states span psi.
For r = 2 and r = 3 the whole dictionary of stabilizer states is small enough
to settle this by enumeration, if the enumeration is organised so that the
work is linear or quadratic in the dictionary rather than a binomial in it.

The organising fact is one quotient at a time. If psi lies in
span(s_1, ..., s_r) then the images of the s_j in C^d / span(psi) are linearly
dependent. For r = 2 that is two parallel directions, found by canonicalising
every direction and sorting once. For r = 3, fix the first state s_i as a pivot
and quotient by span(psi, s_i) as well: if psi is in span(s_i, s_j, s_k) then
the images of s_j and s_k in that second quotient are parallel, which is the
same sort, done once per pivot. The converse fails only when the three states
are themselves dependent, which is why every candidate is retested in the full
space. Every triple has a smallest index, so pivots only look at states with a
larger index and each triple is examined once.

Sorting finds parallel directions through a key that is constant on a
projective point: with u the unit direction, key = (KEY.u)/(CAN.u) for two fixed
generic functionals is unchanged by u -> lambda u. Parallel directions get equal
keys and land adjacent after sorting. The key is not injective on projective
points, though: it is constant on a whole hyperplane of directions, so an
unrelated direction can share a key exactly and sit between two parallel ones
in the sort order. Comparing only adjacent entries would then split the pair.
So the sorted keys are cut into runs wherever consecutive keys differ by more
than a relative 1e-8, and every pair inside a run is tested by its overlap.
Parallel directions have keys equal to rounding and always share a run; an
intruder can only enlarge a run, never separate its members. Runs are tiny
in practice, so the all-pairs test inside them costs nothing.

Before the sort, directions are pushed through a random linear map to a few
dimensions. A linear map preserves collinearity, so a genuine dependency is
still a dependency after projecting and the search cannot lose one; the map
can only propose extra candidates, and every candidate is then tested in the
full space by least squares. This is the same safeguard the T3 m=3 certificate
in this repository documents, and the projected dimension is kept well above
the value at which that certificate saw accidental near-parallel pairs.

Symmetry cuts the pivot loop by three orders of magnitude. The single-copy
Clifford stabilizer of the target (24 elements for the Strange state, 6 for
Norrell, 4 for H3, 3 for T3, 2 for the qubit H-type, 3 for the BK T-type),
the permutations of the copies, and one antiunitary symmetry generate a group
that fixes the target up to phase and permutes the dictionary; a decomposition
can be moved by any element of it onto one containing the representative of
any of its states, so only one pivot per orbit is needed, scanned against
every other state. Every generator is checked at runtime to fix the target
and to permute the dictionary. On three qutrits this leaves 12 (S), 74 (N)
or 116 (H3) pivots of 30240, and on four qubits 186 (H-type) or 62 (T-type)
of 36720.

Everything here is numerical and rests on a margin: the closest any two
non-parallel adjacent directions come to the parallel threshold is returned,
and a certificate should refuse to print its claim when that margin is thin.
The dictionaries themselves are exact up to rounding at 1e-16.
