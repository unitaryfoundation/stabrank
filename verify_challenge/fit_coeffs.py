"""Solve for the exact coefficients of a proposed decomposition.

Submitters supply the stabilizer terms; this recovers the coefficients in exact
arithmetic, or reports that no exact combination of those terms reproduces the
target. Running it before submitting turns a "close" decomposition into either
a submission or a clear no, without burning a verification slot.

The terms are linearly independent in every case that matters (a dependent set
would mean the true rank is lower), so the exact normal equations
(A^H A)^{-1} A^H b give the unique candidate, and it is then checked against the
target on the nose rather than by residual size.

    sqrt(3^k) has entries in {0, 1, w3, w3^2} with w3 = w9^3, and the target

    coefficient as a short polynomial in w9 with rational coefficients, times
    the power of sqrt(3) that restores the normalisations, and the check that
