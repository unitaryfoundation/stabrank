"""Verification pipeline for stabilizer-rank bound submissions.

A submission claims a bound on chi(|M>^{ot m}) for one magic-state orbit. The
pipeline decides what tier it has earned; nothing is taken on the submitter's
word.

Upper bounds carry an explicit decomposition. Each term is given by its
stabilizer parametrisation

    |sigma> propto sum_{y in F_p^k} w_p^{Q(y) + l.y} |x0 + W y>,

not as a raw amplitude vector, so a term that is not a stabilizer state cannot
be expressed in the first place. For qubits the phase group is the fourth roots
of unity rather than the second, so there the phase is i^{l.y} (-1)^{Q(y)} with
l read mod 4 and Q mod 2; every qubit stabilizer state has this form, and with
w_2 = -1 alone the Y eigenstates could not be written at all. The verifier
rebuilds every term and the target in exact arithmetic and requires the
identity to hold on the nose. A floating-point near-miss earns nothing.

Lower bounds cannot be checked from a static witness, so they carry a
certificate script. The pipeline runs it under a time budget and requires it to
exit zero having printed its claim. A bound with no runnable certificate is
recorded at the `cited` tier and is never allowed to set a leaderboard record.

Tiers, in decreasing strength:
    lean        a Lean theorem proves it, and the build receipt confirms it compiles
    verified    exact arithmetic confirmed the decomposition here, or a
                lower-bound certificate exact throughout, with no margin
    reproduced  a certificate script ran to completion and asserted the bound
    attested    the argument is exact but rests on an offline enumeration too
                large for any budget; the certificate checked the hashes of
                every stored batch output, re-decided the stored exceptions,
                and re-ran a declared subset of batches from scratch
    cited       attributed to the literature; not machine-checked

The Lean tier is the one that does not depend on trusting this file. Building
mathlib is far too slow to run on every site build, so a bound claiming it needs
a receipt in certs/lean-<module>.json written by `make lean-certify` after a
real `lake build`. Without the receipt the claim is ignored and the bound falls
back to whatever the exact-arithmetic check earns it, so a Lean claim can never
inflate a tier on its own.
